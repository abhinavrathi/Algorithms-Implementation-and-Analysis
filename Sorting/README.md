#Selection Sort
This Algorithm sequentially checks the complete list for the smallest element by iterator i, with iterator j running from i+1 to end of list. If the ith element wasn't the smallest, elements at i & smallest j are swapped. We then continue with next iteration of i uptill all but one element in the list.<br>
Time Complexity is O(n<sup>2</sup>).<br>
Space Complexity is O(1).
