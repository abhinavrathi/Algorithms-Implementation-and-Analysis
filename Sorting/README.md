#Selection Sort
This Algorithm sequentially checks the complete list for the smallest element with iterator i with iterator j running from i+1 to end of lsit. If ith element wasn't the smallest, elements at i & j are swapped. We then continue with next iteration of i uptill all but one element in list.<br>
Time Complexity is O(n<sup>2</sup>).<br>
Space Complexity is O(1).
